"First, I would like to thank Mdm Vicky Choo for her support. She is the person who guided me from the start of this project and was always generous with her advice and help. I would also like to thank my friends, who tested my website while it was still a draft. Their names are Sherman Loy, Ramanathan Krishna, Emmanuel Low, and Ashton Choo. These kind people strongly believed in this website and helped me turn this project from an idea to reality."
